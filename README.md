# SimpleGrad

A simple implementation of autograd and a pytorch-like framework around it. This implementation focuses on easy to understand codebase and is not optimized for performace. Use this repo as a learning step, if performance is needed then please prefer pytorch (or any other established framework).

* matplotlib
* sklearn
* tqdm
